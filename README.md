![Hello World](/img/Background.png?raw=true "Header")

I enjoy programming and consistently learning from sun up to sun down. 

Here is a quick rundown of my weekday:

- <img src="/img/coffee.svg" alt="coffee" width="25" height="25"> Wake up and have a cup of Joe
- <img src="/img/code.svg" alt="work" width="25" height="25"> Start my day of coding
- <img src="/img/network.svg" alt="network" width="25" height="25"> Network with other coders
- <img src="/img/collaborate.svg" alt="collaborate" width="25" height="25"> Collaborate on a (soon to be open source) project with a few friends for fun
- <img src="/img/write.svg" alt="blog" width="25" height="25"> Write a bit about coding over at [WriteCode.Ninja](https://writecode.ninja)
