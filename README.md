I enjoy programming and consistently learning from sun up to sun down. 

Here is a quick rundown of my weekday:

![coffee](/img/coffee.svg?raw=true "coffee") Wake up and have a cup of Joe
![work](/img/code.svg?raw=true "work") Start my day of coding
![network](/img/network.svg?raw=true "network") Network with other coders
![collaborate](/img/collaborate.svg?raw=true "collaborate") Collaborate on a (soon to be open source) project with a few friends for fun
![blog](/img/write.svg?raw=true "blog") Write a bit about coding over at [WriteCode.Ninja](https://writecode.ninja)
